# Introduction

`UIActionSheet` and `UIAlertView`are common interface elements for presenting the user with a choice or informing them of an abnormal situation. Theyâ€™re simple to use, but it can be tiresome to implement the requisite delegate methods just to figure out which button was tapped.

`RMActionSheet` and `RMAlertView` are drop-in replacements for `UIActionSheet` and `UIAlertView` that use blocks instead of delegation. They provide just as much control as their UIKit counterparts without the headache sorting through various indexes and objects in a single delegate callback.

# Usage

These examples are fairly straightforward:

## RMActionSheet

    RMActionSheet *actionSheet = [RMActionSheet actionSheetWithTitle:@"Title"];
    
    [actionSheet addDestructiveButtonTitle:@"Destroy Foo"
                                    action:^{
                                        NSLog(@"foo destroyed");
                                    }];
    
    [actionSheet addButtonTitle:@"Bar"
                         action:^{
                             [self bar];
                         }];
    
    [actionSheet addCancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                               action:NULL];
    
    [actionSheet showFromBarButtonItem:self.barButtonItem animated:YES];


## RMAlertView

    RMAlertView *alertView = [RMAlertView alertViewWithTitle:@"Title" message:@"Hey, weird something happened!"];
	[alertView addButtonTitle:@"OK"
                       action:^{
                           NSLog(@"OK");
                       }];
	[alertView addCancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                             action:NULL];
	[alertView show];

## Animation Blocks

Since both `UIActionSheetDelegate` and `UIAlertViewDelegate` protocols define presentation callbacks, these subclasses support them:

	[alertView setWillPresentAnimation:^(id actionSheet){
		// do something with action sheet frame
	}
	completion:^(id actionSheet){
		NSLog(@"complete");
	}];

Alternatively, set the following properties directly:

	@property (nonatomic, copy) RMActionSheetAnimationBlock willPresentBlock;
	@property (nonatomic, copy) RMActionSheetAnimationBlock didPresentBlock;
	
	@property (nonatomic, copy) RMActionSheetAnimationBlock willDismissBlock;
	@property (nonatomic, copy) RMActionSheetAnimationBlock didDismissBlock;

## Cancel Block

Finally, the following block is invoked if the action sheet or alert view is cancelled by the system:

	@property (nonatomic, copy) RMActionSheetBlock cancelAction;
